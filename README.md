    		The Problem of Political Authority by Michael Huemer by Michael Huemer
    		Anatomy of the State by Murray Rothbard - This gives a succinct account the state following Franz Oppenheimer and Albert Jay Nock, Rothbard regards the state as a predatory entity.
    		The Law by Frédéric Bastiat - How is it that the law enforcer itself does not have to keep the law? How is it that the law permits the state to lawfully engage in actions which, if undertaken by individuals, would land them in jail?
    		Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy - Murphy takes the role of market insurance in property security and extends the analysis to the security of person. Wonderful piece of reading, here's the audio version also available as free download on iTunes.
    		For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto by Murray N. Rothbard - Libertarianism is Murray N. Rothbard's radical alternative that says state power is unworkable and immoral and ought to be curbed and finally abolished. Rothbard deploys: natural law, natural rights, Austrian economics, American history, the theory of the state, and more to make his case.
