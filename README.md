* Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt - Hazlitt wrote this book following his stint at the New York Times as an editorialist. His hope was to reduce the whole teaching of economics to a few principles and explain them in ways that people would never forget.
* The Problem of Political Authority by Michael Huemer by Michael Huemer
* Anatomy of the State by Murray Rothbard - This gives a succinct account the state following Franz Oppenheimer and Albert Jay Nock, Rothbard regards the state as a predatory entity.
* The Law by Frédéric Bastiat - How is it that the law enforcer itself does not have to keep the law? How is it that the law permits the state to lawfully engage in actions which, if undertaken by individuals, would land them in jail?
* Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy - Murphy takes the role of market insurance in property security and extends the analysis to the security of person. Wonderful piece of reading, here's the audio version also available as free download on iTunes.
